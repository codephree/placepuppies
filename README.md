## Placepuppies 
This a project created by me (Codephree) after registering a new account with Getdev.co

### Purpose of the Project

The purpose of the project is to create an image placeholder for developers to use during development of their new project while they await the real image

### How to use placeholders
  Use the url https://placepuppies.dev/width/height in your img tag. The width and height will be number and must be added 
  before being used. Example ``` <img src = "https://placepuppies.dev/620/920"> ```
